General to-do items for the project.

-Require only profile creation for those who want to post listings. (Limit barriers to entry by requiring only a Net ID login for joiners)
    -This would of course require some restructuring of the existing application.
-Consider adding an auto-notification feature on the posting page, where an interested joiner can simply click a link that will automatically forward a notification of interest to the host (via email) containing details about the interested person, using information from their completed profile.
